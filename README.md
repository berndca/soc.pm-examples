## 1. [Parallella EMMU: Memory translation Unit](https://github.com/parallella/oh/tree/master/src/emmu)

The parallella memory translation unit is a small block with two dependencies, one 
of them is a library. The example1 directory contains a snapshot of the file system 
with the dependencies installed.

The parallella/oh repository has a test bench for the emmu and other blocks.
